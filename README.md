## ðŸ“ƒ Lessons Learnt

Through this project, I learned how to scrape Amazon product pages to extract data like product name, price, rating. I also learned how to track the prices of products over time to identify price drops. Additionally, I learned how to send email notifications to users and automate tasks using Python scripting. Once I did this I developed a local database storage system where the product details will be stored periodically along with date and time, within a csv file. This lets me build a timeseries database and lets me track product price trends on Amazon. I intend to perform a time series analysis on the most popular products and how their prices fluctuate during different times of the year/month/day.
